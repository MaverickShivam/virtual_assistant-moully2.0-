# virtual_assistant-moully2.0-
I made a Virtual Assistant-(Moully2.0) using only python just like JARVIS in iron man. I am new to programming and coding stuffs, so please give your valuable suggestions to improve it.
firstly it will ask you for your name, just tell your name with any sentence, then you need to activate it by saying "heyMoully" pronounced as  haymoli. It wil reply with a beep then ask you for any command.
